#Policy considerations while deploying to the main Datahub

Our goal is to provide a reliable infrastructure that instructors can completely trust while using as part of their coursework. The objective of this policy document is to outline our criteria while deploying a change to the image in the main Datahub/other non-course-specific hubs (Like R Hub). 

- Regular package changes during the start and end of the semester.
- Package, RAM, CPU, and Admin access-related changes during the semester with the robust testing protocol (either automated or manual) in staging and production.
- Enabling new features in the main hubs only after it gets successfully tested with one or many instructors across another course/use case-specific hubs.
